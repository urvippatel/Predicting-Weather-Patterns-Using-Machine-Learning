# Predicting Weather Patterns Using Machine Learning

I used Python to wrangle and analyze weather datasets to determine if machine learning could be utilized to predict future weather patterns. I then created a presentation to communicate my analysis process and results.

## Objective
**Predicting Weather Patterns Using Machine Learning**

Utilize machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change.

Several machine learning approaches were employed to determine if machine learning could predict future weather conditions and identify the most accurate algorithm.

### Key Questions
- How is machine learning used?
- Is it applicable to weather data?
- Are there any ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI that are specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximum and minimum temperatures been?
- Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day?

## Data
- **Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed**: 
  - The data was collected by the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) and includes weather observations such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more from 18 different weather stations across Europe for the years 1960 - 2022.

- **Dataset-Answers-Weather_Prediction_Pleasant_Weather**: 
  - A CSV file containing data that determines if the weather was pleasant or unpleasant for each day from 1960-01-01 to 2022-10-31.

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- **Pandas:** For data analysis.
- **NumPy:** For mathematical equations.
- **Seaborn:** For data visualizations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualizations.
- **sklearn:** For machine learning and statistical modeling.
- **plotly.express:** For data visualizations.
- **plotly.graph_objects:** For creating plots.
- **operator:** A set of efficient functions that perform common operations on built-in data types more efficiently.
- **graphviz:** To create graph objects.

## Visualizations
All visualizations were created in Python.

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- **01 Project Management:** Project Brief & Data Dictionary.
- **02 Data:** Separated into two subfolders: Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the cleaned/prepared data frames for analysis, respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- **03 Scripts:** The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

## Resources
- The weather data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Dataset project. [ECA&D](https://www.ecad.eu/)
- The answer dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis.

## Acknowledgements
- This project is inspired by ClimateWins.
- I would like to thank ECA&D and CareerFoundry for providing the data.
